           live
               The data is assumed to be played at the same timing as it
               arrived.  This is useful for watching termcasts, etc -- giving
               you the ability to rewind to an interesting moment.

       -s X, --speed
           Sets the initial speed to X, a real number between 0.001 and
           1000.0.
