ttyplay - player of the tty session recorded by ttyrec

If  you hit any key during playback, it will go right to the next char‚Äê
acter typed.  This is handy when examining sessions where a user spends
a lot of time at a prompt.

Additionally, there are some special keys defined:

+ or f  double the speed of playback.

- or s  halve the speed of playback.

1      set playback to speed 1.0 again.

p      toggle progress display on and off. May sometimes cause temporary
       mess-up in the display.
