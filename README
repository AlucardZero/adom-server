I. Install and Configuration
----------------------------

A basic Linux system is required.  The distribution should be relatively
modern; Debian 6 or Ubuntu 12.04+ are recommended, but almost any will work.

Please read the included INSTALL file, as there are many moving parts to touch.

II. Usage
---------

The full usage readme is at public_html/readme.php.

SSH in with user adom and password adom, and follow prompts to create a new 
user.
Then SSH in as your new user.

III. Administration
-------------------

To edit the banner on the top of the main menu, edit etc/motd in the server 
homedir. Bash color codes can be used (but double-escape your \s).

To add support for new 1.2.0 prereleases, just edit etc/config and change 
MAX_PRE

Setting up your web server and domain is out of scope for this document, but
is recommended to do.
