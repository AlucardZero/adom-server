I. About
--------

These are scripts to support running a multi-user, multi-version ADOM server,
with useful mods for the game, IRC bots useful for ADOM players, and social
features.

Why?

- ADOM was not at all designed to run multiple versions on the same system.
- For the 10 years with no new versions, mods were the only way to prevent or 
  recover from crashes.
- Mods add neat features like a starsign selector and autoswap with friendlies.
- Database dumps provide invaluable information to the optimal player.
- It is a single player game, but watching other players and seeing their wins
  (or deaths) is social, and having your win be recorded publicly is a great
  ego boost.

ADOM can be found at http://adom.de or http://ancardia.com .

II. Install
-----------

A basic Linux system is required.  The distribution should be relatively
modern; Debian 6+ or Ubuntu 12.04+ are recommended, but almost any will work.

Please read the included INSTALL file, as there are many moving parts to touch.
At the least, you should create a non-root user to own the server scripts, 
before checking out the code.

III. Usage
---------

The full usage readme is at public_html/readme.php.

SSH in with user adom and password adom, and follow prompts to create a new 
user.
Then SSH in as your new user.

IV. Administration
-------------------

To edit the banner on the top of the main menu, edit etc/motd in the server 
homedir. Bash color codes can be used (but double-escape your \s).

To add support for new 1.2.0 prereleases, just edit etc/config and change 
MAX_PRE

Setting up your web server and domain is out of scope for this document, but
is recommended to do.

New ADOM versions require small edits to the binary to enable sharing of
HISCORES and not clobbering other versions. To do this yourself, edit the 
adom binary in a hex editor (like hexcurse) and change both mentions of 
adom_ds.cfg to something unique like adom_ds.900. Then create this file in
/etc and put as its contents the folder you want the .HISCORE to go to.
