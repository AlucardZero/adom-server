I. Install and Configuration
----------------------------

Please read the included INSTALL file, as there are many moving parts to touch.

II. Usage
---------

The full usage readme is at public_html/readme.php.

SSH in with user adom and password adom, and follow prompts to create a new 
user.
Then SSH in as your new user.

III. Administration
-------------------

To edit the banner on the top of the main menu, edit etc/motd in the server 
homedir. Bash color codes can be used (but double-escape your \s).

To add support for new 1.2.0 prereleases, just edit etc/config and change 
MAX_PRE

Setting up your web server and domain is out of scope for this document, but
is recommended to do.

IV. ADOM Sage
-------------

ADOM Sage is included, but new versions of ADOM Sage can be found at
https://github.com/AlucardZero/adom-sage 

To add, check out and compile the code, then move adom-sage and adom-sage.so
to the bin/ directory of the server homedir, with an extenstion like -092.

E.g.:
bin/adom-sage-092
bin/adom-sage-092.so

Then edit the SAGE variable in bin/adom-120pX to your new suffix.

V. Contributing
---------------

Submit a pull request on GitHub and I'll figure it out.
