There is a public, session-recording ADOM (optionally Sage) 1.1.1 / 1.0.0 /
Eternium Man SSH server online on ancardius.ath.cx.

It does not hurt to read through the following instructions before playing.

[Connecting]:

  Connect to the mentioned address, default SSH port, with your SSH-client.

  Please use SSH2 protocol for SSH interaction! The server will not allow the 
  use of the obsolete SSH1 version (PuTTY should use the version 2 by default).
          
  If you're a Windows-user and don't have a SSH-client, download one (PuTTY) 
  from the offical download page 
  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html.
  
  PuTTY is a single executable and needs no installing.

[Spectating]:

  To spectate current players, give username 'spectator' and password 
  'spectator'. 
  You may then choose the game to spectate, if there are players online.

[Playing]:

  To create a new user, give username 'adom' and password 'adom', then log in
  with this newly-created account.

  NOTE: only 3 registrations allowed per IP every day.

  Note that ADOM will not launch if your terminal size is something else than
  80x25 characters!

  You may then choose whether you want to play ADOM 1.1.1, 1.0.0 or Eternium Man
  challenge and whether you want to use Sage or not. Note that 1.1.1/1.0.0/
  Eternium Man have separate save- and hiscore files!

  The server automatically enforces the rules of the Eternium Man challenge.
  Breaking the rules will get your ADOM process killed.

  PROTIP:

    In the game, there is a place called "The Bug-Infested Temple". Normally you
    will need at least a hundred deaths recorded to be allowed entry. However, 
    on the server, you will not need to reach this limit.

[Session recording and playback]:

  Note that every game on the server is recorded!

  You can playback any recorded game by logging in with the username 'ttyrecplay'
  and the password 'ttyrecplay'. Instructions for selecting and playing a recording
  are explained when you log in.

  The recordings are in "ttyrec" format, and can be downloaded from each user's
  WWW-accessable /ttyrecs -directory (if they've enabled WWW access).

[Hiscore]:

  The hiscore dumps of the server are available at the following address:

    http://ancardius.ath.cx/adom_hiscore/

  On the IRC-channel #adom, on IRCNet, there is the IRC-bot AncardiUSBot 
  announcing new Hall of Fame (top 100) entries, if they exceed 10k points.  

[Editing the config files]:

  You are allowed to edit ADOM and ADOM Sage configuration files on the server.
  You can launch the nano editor (see main menu when you log in) for writing 
  your own configurations.

[Miscellaneous]:

  There is a little problem with the terminal bell - spectators are able to 
  send it. 

  You should disable the bell from the playing/spectating terminal.
  In PuTTY, the following settings are highly recommended:

  Window -> Rows: 25 (you NEED this to launch ADOM!)
  Window -> Columns: 80 (this should be the default)
  Terminal -> Bell -> None (bell disabled)
  Features -> Disable application keypad mode
  Terminal -> Keyboard -> xterm R6 (in order to use the function keys properly)

  You will probably want to change the default font, too. Note that you can save
  these settings, including username (Connection -> Auto-login username) in the
  main Session-window.

  If you are used to the DOS or Windows versions of ADOM, it's possible to
  configure PuTTY to look like them; thanks to rmcin329 for finding this:

         ANSI black: 0 0 0        ANSI bold black: 119 119 119
         ANSI red: 255 68 0       ANSI bold red: 255 119 0
         ANSI green: 0 170 0      ANSI bold green: 0 255 0
         ANSI yellow: 153 85 0    ANSI bold yellow: 221 221 0
         ANSI blue: 0 0 170       ANSI bold blue: 0 119 255
         ANSI magenta: 170 0 170  ANSI bold magenta: 255 0 255
         ANSI cyan: 0 170 170     ANSI bold cyan: 0 255 255
         ANSI white: 187 187 187  ANSI bold white: 255 255 255

         If you want the cursor the same as well just use bold white for
         it, and under appearance set it to underline.

  If you use another terminal emulator see its documentation for setting
  colors, obviously.

  If the game happens to crash, there is a supposedly working restore system 
  that allows you to restore the last save game if the ADOM process crashes.

  Also, you can enable your user directory to be accessible (read-only) at
  http://ancardius.ath.cx/adom_users/. You can enable or disable this access any
  time you wish. Useful for exporting character dumps, configs, etc.!

  (...and of course, access your game demos.)

  A somewhat maintained changelog can be found at
  http://ancardius.ath.cx/adom_changes.

[Contact and Thanks]:

  Please report any trouble (which I expect, since this is a very alpha-stage 
  system) to jaakkos on IRCNet, Quakenet or Freenode, sorear on Freenode or
  IRCNet, or to Chousuke on IRCNet.

  You might also want to visit the #adom channel in IRCNet, but then again you 
  might not want to.  There is also #adom on Freenode (newer, smaller, and
  friendlier) and #ancardius on ancardius.ath.cx:6667 (mostly used for tourney
  coordination) (XXX will someone who knows something about quakenet add
  something here).
  
  Huge thanks to Chousuke and Vladimir Panteleev for making all this possible!

  Sensible enhancement ideas are also welcome!
  Have fun playing!
